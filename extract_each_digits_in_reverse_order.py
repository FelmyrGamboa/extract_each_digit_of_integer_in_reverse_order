# Exercise 11: Write a Program to extract each digit from an integer in the reverse order.
# For example, If the given int is 7536, the output shall be “6 3 5 7“, with a space separating the digits.

#Create a variable containing the integer

#Create a loop with a certain condition to stop
#Reverse the integer by dividing it by 10 and getting the remainder
#Assign the quotient as the new integer to be divided
#Display the result with spaces
